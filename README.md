Dataset
Describe the dataset used in your project. Include information on the features, target variable, and any data preprocessing steps undertaken.

# Model Training
The RandomForestRegressor model was trained using a subset of the dataset, employing various hyperparameter configurations to optimize its performance. Cross-validation techniques were applied to assess the model's generalization capabilities, ensuring robustness in predicting unseen data. Additionally, feature engineering was performed to enhance the model's ability to capture essential patterns within the data.

# Evaluation
The performance of the predictive model was evaluated using standard regression metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. These metrics provide insights into the model's accuracy and precision in predicting airline prices.




# Results
